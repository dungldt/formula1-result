Build an Fomular 1 Racing Results Webpage with ReactJS

The application is built using **React.js (v16.14.0)**, along with several other key packages, as listed in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "bootstrap": "^5.2.0-beta1",
  "chart.js": "^4.3.0",
  "chartjs-plugin-datalabels": "^2.2.0",
  "react": "^16.14.0",
  "react-bootstrap-table-next": "^4.0.3",
  "react-bootstrap-table2-toolkit": "^2.1.3",
  "react-chartjs-2": "^5.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^16.14.0"
}
```
